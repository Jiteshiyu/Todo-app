## Demo

You can view a live demo of the project [Todojo](https://todojo.netlify.app/).

## Features

- Add new tasks to the todo list
- Delete tasks from the list
- Mark tasks as complete
- Complete all tasks at once
- Responsive and clean UI design

## Technologies Used

- React (for building the UI)
- Vite (for fast development environment)
- JavaScript/JSX (for logic and structure)
- UUID (for generating unique IDs for each task)
- CSS (for styling)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

Ensure that **Node.js** and **npm** are installed on your machine. If not, you can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jiteshiyu/Todojo.git
   cd Todojo
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server.
- `npm run build`: Build the app for production.
- `npm run preview`: Preview the production build locally.

## How It Works

The app is built with React and uses the `useState` hook for managing the todo list state.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Todo State Management:** The app maintains an array of todo objects, each with a `task`, `id`, and `isDone` property. The state is updated when users add, delete, or mark tasks as complete.
2. **Adding Todos:** Users can enter a task in the input field and submit it via the form. The task is added to the todo list along with a unique `id` (generated by the `uuid` library) and a default `isDone` state of `false`.
3. **Marking Todos as Complete:** Users can click on the "Complete" button to mark a specific task as complete. Completed tasks will be visually crossed out.
4. **Deleting Todos:** Users can delete a task by clicking the "Delete" button, which removes the task from the todo list.
5. **Complete All:** Users can mark all tasks as complete with a single button click, updating the `isDone` property of all tasks to `true`.

## Future Improvements

- **Add Local Storage Support:** Persist the todo list across page reloads using browser local storage.
- **Edit Todo:** Implement functionality to allow users to edit existing tasks.
- **Filter Tasks:** Add filtering options to view only completed or pending tasks.
- **Animations:** Add subtle animations for adding or removing todos for a better user experience.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **State Management:** Using Reactâ€™s `useState` hook for managing a dynamic list of tasks helped in understanding how to update and manipulate arrays in state.
- **Component Reusability:** Breaking down the todo list into separate components (`TodoForm`, `TodoItem`, `TodoList`) made the app more modular and easy to maintain.
- **Efficient Rendering:** Using unique `id`s with the `key` prop for each todo item helped prevent unnecessary re-renders and ensured smooth list updates.
