# Todo App with React

This is a Todo App built with React.js where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. It also supports a "Complete All" feature. This app demonstrates component-based architecture and state management using React's `useState` hook.

## Demo

You can view a live demo of the project [here](#).

## Features

- Add new tasks to the todo list
- Delete tasks from the list
- Mark tasks as complete
- Complete all tasks at once
- Responsive and clean UI design

## Technologies Used

- React (for building the UI)
- Vite (for fast development environment)
- JavaScript/JSX (for logic and structure)
- CSS (for styling)
- UUID (for generating unique IDs for each task)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your machine. If not, you can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jiteshiyu/Todo-app.git
   cd Todo-app
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action.

- `App.jsx`: The main application component that renders the `Todo` component.
- `Todo.jsx`: Manages the state for the list of todos and the operations to add, delete, or mark tasks as complete.
- `TodoForm.jsx`: Contains the form for adding a new task.
- `TodoItem.jsx`: Displays individual todo items with actions to complete or delete them.
- `TodoList.jsx`: Renders the list of todos using the `TodoItem` component.
- `App.css` and `index.css`: Contains the styling for the application.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server.
- `npm run build`: Build the app for production.
- `npm run preview`: Preview the production build locally.

## How It Works

The app is built with React and uses the `useState` hook for managing the todo list state. Here’s a breakdown of its functionality:

1. Todo State Management: The app maintains an array of todo objects, each with a `task`, `id`, and `isDone` property. The state is updated when users add, delete, or mark tasks as complete.
2. Adding Todos: Users can enter a task in the input field and submit it via the form. The task is added to the todo list along with a unique `id` (generated by the `uuid` library) and a default `isDone` state of `false`.
3. Marking Todos as Complete: Users can click on the "Complete" button to mark a specific task as complete. Completed tasks will be visually crossed out.
4. Deleting Todos: Users can delete a task by clicking the "Delete" button, which removes the task from the todo list.
5. Complete All: Users can mark all tasks as complete with a single button click, updating the `isDone` property of all tasks to `true`.

## Future Improvements

- Add Local Storage Support: Persist the todo list across page reloads using browser local storage.
- Edit Todo: Implement functionality to allow users to edit existing tasks.
- Filter Tasks: Add filtering options to view only completed or pending tasks.
- Animations: Add subtle animations for adding or removing todos for a better user experience.

## Challenges and Learnings

- State Management: Using React’s `useState` hook for managing a dynamic list of tasks helped in understanding how to update and manipulate arrays in state.
- Component Reusability: Breaking down the todo list into separate components (`TodoForm`, `TodoItem`, `TodoList`) made the app more modular and easy to maintain.
- Efficient Rendering: Using unique `id`s with the `key` prop for each todo item helped prevent unnecessary re-renders and ensured smooth list updates.
